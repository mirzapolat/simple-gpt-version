# Usage of OpenAI API for GPT Models

This is only using the OpenAI API with `import openai`. 

To use, add a file called `openai_key.txt` with your personal OpenAI API Key inside. You can customize the personality of the GPT responder by editing the character description in `model_description.txt`.
